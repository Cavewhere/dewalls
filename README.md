A C++/Qt parser for the Walls .srv cave survey data format

I'm on a crusade to liberate survey data from the Walls format so it can be used in modern 3D cave survey viewers.
The Walls format is far more complicated than any other cave survey data format I know of, which is probably why I
haven't known of any other programs that can read or write Walls data.  But that will soon change thanks to this library.

More details coming soon...
