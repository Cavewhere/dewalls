A C++/Qt parser for the Walls .srv cave survey data format

I'm on a crusade to liberate survey data from the Walls format so it can be used in modern 3D cave survey viewers like [Cavewhere](https://github.com/Cavewhere/cavewhere) and [Breakout](https://github.com/jedwards1211/breakout).
The Walls format is far more complicated than any other cave survey data format I know of, which is probably why I
haven't known of any other programs that can read or write Walls data.  But that will soon change thanks to this library.

I've been careful to write very clean and precise code for this parser, but the documentation is...pretty much nonexistent :)  If you're interested in using this for your own program, let me know and I'll write up documentation and help you get started.
